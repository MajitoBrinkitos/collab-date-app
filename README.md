# Project Name: Collab Dating Apps
### Description: 
There are many dating apps in the market nowadays, and every single one of them targets the audience in a different way by the way they approach possible users.
After doing some research and even interviewing people from different ages and interests, I came to the conclusion that the Dating App World still can be improved. Therefore, I consider this is a good idea for my Project.

## Project Structure
1. Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar contains the menu with the following sections:
-Home
-AboutUs
-Media
-Stories
-Contact

2. Logo Section
The logo section is located at the top of the page, after the Navigation Bar, and contains the logo of the app.

3. Hero Header
This section introduces the user and the application, with a welcoming message and two buttons to download the mobile app.

## Features
1. Moving background
The background of the Logo Section was designed to create an effect of movement using the main colors of the website.
2. Dark/Light Mode
The website offers the option of changing between a dark and light mode, based on the user's preferences.
3. iOS and Android buttons
These buttons are located in the Hero Header section, and contain a link that simulates the downloading of the iOS and Android mobile version of "Collab".
